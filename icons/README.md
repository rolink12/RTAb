# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, placeholder icons are referenced in the manifest.json.
You can replace these with your own custom icons by creating PNG files with the exact names above.

The icons should represent the "Modern Homepage" branding and be optimized for different sizes.

Recommended design:
- Simple, recognizable symbol
- High contrast for visibility
- Consistent with the app's modern design
- Works well at small sizes
